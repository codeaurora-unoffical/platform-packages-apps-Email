        Email providers that are considered "universal" and are appropriate for *all* android
        platform devices should be defined in providers.xml.

        And we suggest to add some other providers such as for new spec in this file.
        We will get the provider from the file according to the value of property
        persist.env.c.email.carrier.

        And we need set the spec value as ct,cu or cmcc as same as which is defined in spec.

        For example, we set the value of persist.env.c.email.carrier to "ct", and then if we
        want to load the provider for CT, we should set the spec of the attribute value as "ct".

    <!-- 189 mail variants -->
    <provider id="ct189" label="189" domain="189.cn" spec="ct">
        <incoming uri="imap://imap.189.cn" username="$email" />
        <outgoing uri="smtp://smtp.189.cn:25" username="$email" />
    </provider>
